# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition, abbreviated as SER, is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. This is also the phenomenon that animals like dogs and horses employ to be able to understand human emotion.

***Speech Emotion Recognition – Objective***

To build a model to recognize emotion from speech using the librosa and sklearn libraries and the RAVDESS dataset.

***The Dataset***

For this Python mini project, we’ll use the RAVDESS dataset; this is the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song dataset, and is free to download. This dataset has 7356 files rated by 247 individuals 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness. The entire dataset is 24.8GB from 24 actors, but we’ve lowered the sample rate on all the files, and you can download it here. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWsrN2Ep7x6lWqOXfr4rpKGYrJhWc8z7/view

***Prerequisites***
You’ll need to install the following libraries with pip:

pip install librosa soundfile numpy sklearn pyaudio

If you run into issues installing librosa with pip, you can try it with conda.
